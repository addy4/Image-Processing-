# Image-Processing
This repository consists Python/OCTAVE codes for implementation of the following : 

1. Histogram matching (Octave). Where the histogram of the source image is made to match that of a target image.
2. Construction of image mosaics. This implementation makes use of the 'Color Transfer algorithm given by Reinhard et al, 2001'. The given python code matches each ROI of source-grid (block of grid) to the ROI of target image. This makes the grid look like a mosaic for the target image.
